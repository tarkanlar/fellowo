        <p>
          Welcome to Fellowo, a software platform that enables users to meet
          with others around them that share interests and goals. The platform
          is managed by Fellowo dba Fellowo Technologies, Inc. ("Fellowo," "we,"
          "us" or "our"), a software company that uses machine learning to
          create meaningful connections.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy ("Our Policy", or the "Policy") explains how we
          collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our website
          (<a href="https://Fellowo.com/">Fellowo.com</a>), and any software
          provided on or in connection with our services (collectively, the
          "Service"), and your choices about the collection and use of your
          information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the
          Service ("Users").
        </p>

        <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

        <h3>Registration Information</h3>

        <p>

        <h3>Location Information</h3>

        <p>
          We may collect location data while you are actively using the Service
          on a mobile device. This information is not shared externally and is
          used by the Service to determine connections within your vicinity who
          are also actively using the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>Google Permissions</h3>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          If you provide us with permission to use your contacts list, the
          Service will access your contacts list to expand the social network of
          friends using Fellowo. You understand and agree that you are
          responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from
